ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Mark Grothe

I'm a full stack software engineer, currently working on the [Scout PD team](https://scout-pd.com/product). In my free time, I'm learning about web3 and building with [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-â€¦)

### Other Skills
When I'm not writing code, I like to build stuff. Here's my latest project. White oak table top and skirt, retrofitted onto an old base (I also made the built in cabinets in the background):
